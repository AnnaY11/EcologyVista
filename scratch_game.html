        <h1>Our Sustainable Practice Interactive Games</h1>
        <p1 >Through these two different games you get to learn about the different pollutants and what they do. Oil spills are a natural disaster, which not only affect our drinking water, but also wildlife. Pollutants like rotten food being tossed on the ground or in the ocean can harm our wildlife and water quality. These pollutants can also be left behind for an animal to eat and suffer from. On the first game make sure to bounce the oil cans so they do not spill. Oil spills are harmful to both wildlife and water quality. On the second game avoid the rotten food and taking busses. Instead go the more sustainable route and ride an electrical car. The gasses released by a gas powered motor vehicle severely impact our air quality. We should avoid heavily using fossil fuels like oil and gas so we can mantain a clean and healthy air quality.  </p1>
